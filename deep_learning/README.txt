This folder contains data, code, models and results for the deep learning part of the project 

LSTM_individualised are neural networks trained on data from one specific subject and applied to data from the same subject. 
The goal was to verify the capabilities of the problem definition and the model architecture for our specific problem.

LSTM_generalised is a neural network trained on data from 3 subjects and applied on data from 5 unseen subjects. 
Closer to a real application, but require more work (bigger dataset) before being deployed. 

Specific README.txt are provided in the LSTM_individualised and LSTM_generalised folders.
